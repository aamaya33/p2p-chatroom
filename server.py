I store my messages in my database so that when a user disconnects, then reconnects and they get my messages
what is important is the time stamps so we see when they logged off and get all messages that weren't sent since that time 
logic can be like if(isOnline) then send message else store message in database
when user logs back in, we check the database for messages and send them to the user
we can also store the messages in a hash table with the key being the user and the value being a list of messages for constant time access XD 


USER MESSAGES DB
messageID: int -> autoincrement
destination: string -> 127.0.0.1 (_ if recieving message)
source: string -> 127.0.0.1 ( _ if sending messsage)
message: string -> "Hello"
timeStamp: timeStamp UTC -> "12:00"
isRead: bool -> False

OR 2 DIFFERENT TABLES FOR RECIEVED AND SENT ?

ids are either guids or autoincremented integers

guid good because the user can't guess the next message id and can't read other messages but not best performance (good for identity) 

autoincremented integers are good because they are faster and you can do a lot more with them but they are predictable
